# format is (player military skill),(command stat),(luck stat),(commander skill name),(formation)

# See commander_bonuses.txt for known commander skills
# See formations.txt for known formation names

# listed in order, top to bottom, front to back
# use ship codes in player_ships.txt, basic format is (size)(tier)(type letter)(abcde)
# note some type letters are not obvious (examples s- shield for armored, n - domination, x - special)
# full ship name, i.e L-1 Assault Ship a, can be used too
# layout below has l1aa line 2, l1da line 3, l1aa line 4, and m1aa,m1pa line 5, assault in the front

# use ship codes in enemy_ships.txt, typical format is (size)(abbreviation)(abcde)

# Attacks section
# for each attack, list the stats (torp A-S,A-M,A-L plasma A-S,A-M,A-L) before the attack starts for both sides
# then list the damage each side suffers on that turn
# basic damage format is damage(units remaining), e.g. 826(1) means ship took 826 damage, and has 1 unit left afterwards
# each damage entry is the five lines, top to bottom, separated by commas
# only record damage entries for the two columns of "active" ships (no other ships can be hit)
# if no ship on a line takes a hit, leave that entry BLANK
# if there are two ships in the active two lines, separate their damage entries with /, list the first ship entry first
# examples: 826(1)/ means "two ships on a line, front ship took 826 damage, back ship wasn't hit"
# /999(3) means "two ships, front wasn't hit, back took 999 damage" (this isn't likely)
# 999(0)/333(1) means "front ship took 999, destroyed, back ship took 333 and one unit left"

# use 1,2,3 between the dots to indicate turn number
